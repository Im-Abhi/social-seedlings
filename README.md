This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

# Social Seedlings
Something similar to the instagram user feed, data is fetched from the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).

At once 10 posts are shown and have an infinite scroll.

You can view the number of user, number of likes, the post image, and the date created.

We can also visit the user profile by clicking on the username in any post.

#### !Note!
The hexagon like feature is just for presentation (UI) purpose and doesn't have any functionality.
